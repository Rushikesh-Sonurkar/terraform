Terraform
This repo is my hands-on playground for learning and applying Terraform. I'm using it to experiment with Infrastructure as Code, automate cloud setups, and build reusable modules that reflect real-world environments. Everything here is a work in progress as I deepen my understanding of provisioning, modularization, and deployment workflows.
